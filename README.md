## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Intelligent Data Management

Space Explorer employs a sophisticated data management system that:

1. **Checks in-memory storage first** for previously fetched data
2. **Fetches from NASA APIs** only when necessary
3. **Caches responses** to reduce API calls and improve performance
4. **Handles proper type conversions** between NASA API formats and our internal data structures

### Performance Optimizations

- **Data caching**: Reduces duplicate API calls
- **Lazy loading**: Improves initial page load times
- **Optimal bundling**: Minimizes JS payload size
- **TypeScript**: Catches errors at compile time

### Responsive Design Philosophy

The UI is built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS:

- **Fluid typography**: Adjusts text size based on viewport
- **Responsive grid layouts**: Reorganize based on available space
- **Touch-friendly controls**: Large tap targets on mobile devices
- **Dark/light mode**: Automatic theme detection with manual override
